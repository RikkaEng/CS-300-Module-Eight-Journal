# What was the problem you were solving in the project for this course?
The main premise of Projects One and Two. I was using a BigO analysis to test different data structures. Mainly Vectors, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees. There were different test cases that the project wanted me to analyze, mainly, the conversion from a CSV file and parsing it into said data structure. The goal was to load, store, and retrieve course information in the most optimised way possible. I.E, in the vein of which data structure either had the most efficient BigO value, or which one had the smallet clock() time. We wanted to know which structure was best suited for accessing data quickly in different particiular ways.

#How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are improtant to understand.
There were many problems that this assignment asked me to do, I was tasked with finding the memory demands of three different data structures, mainly in the form of how much it would require to either search for a specific index within the structure, or sort them in alphanumerical order and printing them. It was a rather tedious process, similar to a lab, where I simply constructed each entity like as though they were an experient and jotted down the data and compared. I found that data structures are important to understand so that I'll be able to use them effectively in future endeavors, such as Vectors being good for tables that need constant resizing, Hash Tables being optimized for quick look ups, and BSTs being good for maintaining a sorted order and even printing said sorted order.

#How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I didn't run into too many roadblock if I will be honest. I'm still learning C++, but exercises like these, help me practice and become more fluent in the language. In vein of spending alot of time on google, my only biggest hurdle was time management.

#How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Well it's nice to have hands on experience with the large forms of Lists/Arrays. I remember learning about them in my first course in SNHU. In the form of using Hash Tables & BSTs, and learning the different benefits of each data structures, it's broaden my understanding of how data retrieval is done, and I will likely implement this knowledge into future endeavoprs when it comes to designing data structures.

#How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable.
Only as I write more code, I'll be able to see bigger and broader pictures better, and thus I'll be able to write code that is clean, easily legible, and modular. I've always felt like my comments are straight to the point, and having headers on each of my functions has made my code easy to navigate.
